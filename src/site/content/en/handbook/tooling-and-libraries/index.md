  Guidance on selecting the tooling and libraries for web.dev content.
---

This posts explains how to select tooling and libraries for web.dev content that requires non-native dependencies.

## Open source

Open-source tools and libraries should be used as much as possible. Using open-source software helps keep web.dev accessible to as many developers as possible.

For topic areas that are dominated by proprietary solutions, web.dev should provide at least one open-source option (when available) along with proprietary options. 


## Use well-known and well-established tooling.

Choosing tooling can be one of the most overwhelming and time consuming aspects of web development. We want users to feel confident and well-supported with the tooling they choose, so web.dev deliberately focuses on providing instructions for the most well-known and well-established tooling and libraries. The tooling mentioned on web.dev is not intended to be an exhaustive listing of all available options.

Third-party contributions should focus on tooling that meets at least one of these criteria:



*   **[HTTP Archive](https://httparchive.org)** **data:** Tooling is used by ≥ 10K domains
*   **npm weekly downloads statistics:** Tooling consistently has ≥ 50K weekly downloads.

If the nature of the tooling in question makes it impossible to use either of these data sources to verify its popularity (e.g., if you were writing an article on servers, neither of these data sources could be used to verify usage of nginx), this can alternatively be demonstrated by providing a list of 5–10 well-known sites who’ve self-identified as users.
